ID=Disable CCleaner Health Check
Ver=1.0
Desc=Recently Piriform, maker of CCleaner (aquired by Avast in 2017), released a new version of CCleaner which comes with a brand new feature called "Health Check". This option has been developed to replace previous "Easy Clean" feature which was implemented for non-technical users to scan and clean unnecessary files quickly and easily without any technical knowledge.\n\nRun this script, if you at least want to see the familiar home screen - now called "Custom Clean" - from previous versions, which provides full control over the cleanup options.
