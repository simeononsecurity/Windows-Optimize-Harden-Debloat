			<string id="AccessibilityImageLabelsEnabled" >Enable Get Image Descriptions from Google.</string>
			<string id="AccessibilityImageLabelsEnabled_Explain" >The Get Image Descriptions from Google
accessibility feature enables visually-impaired screen reader users to
get descriptions of unlabeled images on the web. Users who choose to enable it
will have the option of using an anonymous Google service to provide
automatic descriptions for unlabeled images they encounter on the web.

If this feature is enabled, the content of images will be sent to Google
servers in order to generate a description. No cookies or other user
data is sent, and Google does not save or log any image content.

If this policy is set to true, the
Get Image Descriptions from Google
feature will be enabled, though it will only affect users who are using a
screen reader or other similar assistive technology.

If this policy is set to false, users will not have the option of enabling
the feature.

			<string id="AdvancedProtectionAllowed_Explain" >This policy controls whether users enrolled in the Advanced Protection program receive extra protections. Some of these features may involve the sharing of data with Google (for example, Advanced Protection users will be able to send their downloads to Google for malware scanning). If set to True or not set, enrolled users will receive extra protections. If set to False, Advanced Protection users will receive only the standard consumer features.</string>
			<string id="AllowDeletingBrowserHistory" >Enable deleting browser and download history</string>
			<string id="AllowDeletingBrowserHistory_Explain" >Enables deleting browser history and download history in Google Chrome and prevents users from changing this setting.

Note that even with this policy disabled, the browsing and download history are not guaranteed to be retained: users may be able to edit or delete the history database files directly, and the browser itself may expire or archive any or all history items at any time.

If this setting is enabled or not set, browsing and download history can be deleted.

If this setting is disabled, browsing and download history cannot be deleted.</string>
			<string id="AllowDinosaurEasterEgg" >Allow Dinosaur Easter Egg Game</string>
			<string id="AllowDinosaurEasterEgg_Explain" >Allow users to play dinosaur easter egg game when device is offline.

If this policy is set to False, users will not be able to play the dinosaur easter egg game when device is offline. If this setting is set to True, users are allowed to play the dinosaur game. If this policy is not set, users are not allowed to play the dinosaur easter egg game on enrolled Chrome OS, but are allowed to play it under other circumstances.</string>
			<string id="AllowFileSelectionDialogs" >Allow invocation of file selection dialogs</string>
			<string id="AllowFileSelectionDialogs_Explain" >Allows access to local files on the machine by allowing Google Chrome to display file selection dialogs.

If you enable this setting, users can open file selection dialogs as normal.

If you disable this setting, whenever the user performs an action which would provoke a file selection dialog (like importing bookmarks, uploading files, saving links, etc.) a message is displayed instead and the user is assumed to have clicked Cancel on the file selection dialog.

If this setting is not set, users can open file selection dialogs as normal.</string>
			<string id="AllowOutdatedPlugins" >Allow running plugins that are outdated</string>
			<string id="AllowOutdatedPlugins_Explain" >If you enable this setting, outdated plugins are used as normal plugins.

If you disable this setting, outdated plugins will not be used and users will not be asked for permission to run them.

If this setting is not set, users will be asked for permission to run outdated plugins.</string>
			<string id="AllowPopupsDuringPageUnload" >Allows a page to show popups during its unloading</string>
			<string id="AllowPopupsDuringPageUnload_Explain" >This policy allows an admin to specify that a page may show popups during its unloading.

When the policy is set to enabled, pages are allowed to show popups while they are being unloaded.

When the policy is set to disabled or not set, pages are not allowed to show popups while they are being unloaded, as per the spec (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#apis-for-creating-and-navigating-browsing-contexts-by-name).

This policy will be removed in Chrome 88.

			<string id="AllowedDomainsForApps" >Define domains allowed to access G Suite</string>
			<string id="AllowedDomainsForApps_Explain" >Enables Google Chrome's restricted log in feature in G Suite and prevents users from changing this setting.

If you define this setting, the user will only be able to access Google
Apps using accounts from the specified domains (note that to allow
gmail.com/googlemail.com accounts, you should add &quot;consumer_accounts&quot;
(without quotes) to the list of domains).

This setting will prevent the user from logging in, and adding a Secondary
Account, on a managed device that requires Google authentication, if that
account does not belong to the aforementioned list of allowed domains.

If you leave this setting empty/not-configured, the user will be able to
access G Suite with any account.

This policy causes the X-GoogApps-Allowed-Domains header to be appended to
all HTTP and HTTPS requests to all google.com domains, as described in
https://support.google.com/a/answer/1668854.

Users cannot change or override this setting.

Example value: managedchrome.com,example.com</string>
			<string id="AlternateErrorPagesEnabled" >Enable alternate error pages</string>
			<string id="AlternateErrorPagesEnabled_Explain" >Enables the use of alternate error pages that are built into Google Chrome (such as 'page not found') and prevents users from changing this setting.

If you enable this setting, alternate error pages are used.

If you disable this setting, alternate error pages are never used.

If you enable or disable this setting, users cannot change or override this setting in Google Chrome.

If this policy is left not set, this will be enabled but the user will be able to change it.</string>
			<string id="AlwaysOpenPdfExternally" >Always Open PDF files externally</string>
			<string id="AlwaysOpenPdfExternally_Explain" >Disables the internal PDF viewer in Google Chrome. Instead it treats it as download and allows the user to open PDF files with the default application.

If this policy is left not set or disabled the PDF plugin will be used to open PDF files unless the user disables it.</string>
			<string id="AmbientAuthenticationInPrivateModesEnabled" >Enable Ambient Authentication for profile types.</string>
			<string id="AmbientAuthenticationInPrivateModesEnabled_Explain" >Configuring this policy will allow/disallow ambient authentication for Incognito and Guest profiles in Google Chrome.

Ambient Authentication is http authentication with default credentials if explicit credentials are not provided via NTLM/Kerberos/Negotiate challenge/response schemes.

Setting the RegularOnly (value 0), allows ambient authentication for Regular sessions only. Incognito and Guest sessions wouldn't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

Setting the IncognitoAndRegular (value 1), allows ambient authentication for Incognito and Regular sessions. Guest sessions wouldn't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

Setting the GuestAndRegular (value 2), allows ambient authentication for Guest and Regular sessions. Incognito sessions wouldn't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

Setting the  All (value 3), allows ambient authentication for all sessions.

Note that, ambient authentication is always allowed on regular profiles.

In Google Chrome version 81 and later, if the policy is left not set, ambient authentication will be enabled in regular sessions only.</string>
			<string id="AmbientAuthenticationInPrivateModesEnabled_RegularOnly" >Enable ambient authentication in regular sessions only.</string>
			<string id="AmbientAuthenticationInPrivateModesEnabled_IncognitoAndRegular" >Enable ambient authentication in incognito and regular sessions.</string>
			<string id="AmbientAuthenticationInPrivateModesEnabled_GuestAndRegular" >Enable ambient authentication in guest and regular sessions.</string>
			<string id="AmbientAuthenticationInPrivateModesEnabled_All" >Enable ambient authentication in regular, incognito and guest sessions.</string>
			<string id="AppCacheForceEnabled" >Allows the AppCache feature to be re-enabled even if it is off by default.</string>
			<string id="AppCacheForceEnabled_Explain" >If set to true, this will force AppCache to be enabled, even when AppCache in Chrome is not available by default.

If unset or set to false, AppCache will follow Chrome's defaults.</string>
			<string id="ApplicationLocaleValue" >Application locale</string>
			<string id="ApplicationLocaleValue_Explain" >Configures the application locale in Google Chrome and prevents users from changing the locale.

If you enable this setting, Google Chrome uses the specified locale. If the configured locale is not supported, 'en-US' is used instead.

If this setting is disabled or not set, Google Chrome uses either the user-specified preferred locale (if configured), the system locale or the fallback locale 'en-US'.

Example value: en</string>
			<string id="AudioCaptureAllowed" >Allow or deny audio capture</string>
			<string id="AudioCaptureAllowed_Explain" >If enabled or not configured (default), the user will be prompted for
audio capture access except for URLs configured in the
AudioCaptureAllowedUrls list which will be granted access without prompting.

When this policy is disabled, the user will never be prompted and audio
capture only be available to URLs configured in AudioCaptureAllowedUrls.

This policy affects all types of audio inputs and not only the built-in microphone.</string>
			<string id="AudioCaptureAllowedUrls" >URLs that will be granted access to audio capture devices without prompt</string>
			<string id="AudioCaptureAllowedUrls_Explain" >Patterns in this list will be matched against the security
origin of the requesting URL.  If a match is found, access to audio
capture devices will be granted without prompt.

For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.

NOTE: Until version 45, this policy was only supported in Kiosk mode.

Example value:

https://www.example.com/
https://[*.]example.edu/</string>
			<string id="AudioSandboxEnabled" >Allow the audio sandbox to run</string>
			<string id="AudioSandboxEnabled_Explain" >This policy controls the audio process sandbox.
If this policy is enabled, the audio process will run sandboxed.
If this policy is disabled, the audio process will run unsandboxed and the WebRTC audio-processing module will run in the renderer process.
This leaves users open to security risks related to running the audio subsystem unsandboxed.
If this policy is not set, the default configuration for the audio sandbox will be used, which may differ per platform.
This policy is intended to give enterprises flexibility to disable the audio sandbox if they use security software setups that interfere with the sandbox.</string>
			<string id="AutoOpenAllowedForURLs" >URLs where AutoOpenFileTypes can apply</string>
			<string id="AutoOpenAllowedForURLs_Explain" >List of URLs specifying which urls AutoOpenFileTypes will apply to. This policy has no impact on automatically open values set by users.

If this policy is set, files will only automatically open by policy if the url is part of this set and the file type is listed in AutoOpenFileTypes. If either condition is false the download won't automatically open by policy.

If this policy isn't set, all downloads where the file type is in AutoOpenFileTypes will automatically open.

A URL pattern has to be formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format.

Example value:

example.com
https://ssl.server.com
hosting.com/good_path
https://server:8080/path
.exact.hostname.com</string>
			<string id="AutoOpenFileTypes" >List of file types that should be automatically opened on download</string>
			<string id="AutoOpenFileTypes_Explain" >List of file types that should be automatically opened on download. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type, so list &quot;txt&quot; instead of &quot;.txt&quot;.

Files with types that should be automatically opened will still be subject to the enabled safe browsing checks and won't be opened if they fail those checks.

If this policy isn't set, only file types that a user has already specified to automatically be opened will do so when downloaded.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain. or Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management.

Example value:

exe

			<string id="AutofillAddressEnabled" >Enable AutoFill for addresses</string>
			<string id="AutofillAddressEnabled_Explain" >Enables Google Chrome's AutoFill feature and allows users to auto complete address information in web forms using previously stored information.

If this setting is disabled, Autofill will never suggest, or fill address information, nor will it save additional address information that the user might submit while browsing the web.

If this setting is enabled or has no value, the user will be able to control Autofill for addresses in the UI.</string>
			<string id="AutofillCreditCardEnabled" >Enable AutoFill for credit cards</string>
			<string id="AutofillCreditCardEnabled_Explain" >Enables Google Chrome's AutoFill feature and allows users to auto complete credit card information in web forms using previously stored information.

If this setting is disabled, Autofill will never suggest, or fill credit card information, nor will it save additional credit card information that the user might submit while browsing the web.

If this setting is enabled or has no value, the user will be able to control Autofill for credit cards in the UI.</string>
			<string id="AutoplayAllowed" >Allow media autoplay</string>
			<string id="AutoplayAllowed_Explain" >Allows you to control if videos can play automatically (without user consent) with audio content in Google Chrome.

If the policy is set to True, Google Chrome is allowed to autoplay media.
If the policy is set to False, Google Chrome is not allowed to autoplay media. The AutoplayWhitelist policy can be used to override this for certain URL patterns.
By default, Google Chrome is not allowed to autoplay media. The AutoplayWhitelist policy can be used to override this for certain URL patterns.

Note that if Google Chrome is running and this policy changes, it will be applied only to new opened tabs. Therefore some tabs might still observe the previous behavior.</string>
			<string id="AutoplayWhitelist" >Allow media autoplay on a whitelist of URL patterns</string>
			<string id="AutoplayWhitelist_Explain" >Controls the whitelist of URL patterns that autoplay will always be enabled on.

If autoplay is enabled then videos can play automatically (without user consent) with audio content in Google Chrome.

If the AutoplayAllowed policy is set to True then this policy will have no effect.

If the AutoplayAllowed policy is set to False then any URL patterns set in this policy will still be allowed to play.

Note that if Google Chrome is running and this policy changes, it will be applied only to new opened tabs. Therefore some tabs might still observe the previous behavior.

			<string id="BackgroundModeEnabled" >Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed</string>
			<string id="BackgroundModeEnabled_Explain" >Determines whether a Google Chrome process is started on OS login and keeps running when the last browser window is closed, allowing background apps and the current browsing session to remain active, including any session cookies. The background process displays an icon in the system tray and can always be closed from there.

If this policy is set to True, background mode is enabled and cannot be controlled by the user in the browser settings.

If this policy is set to False, background mode is disabled and cannot be controlled by the user in the browser settings.

If this policy is left unset, background mode is initially disabled and can be controlled by the user in the browser settings.</string>
			<string id="BlockThirdPartyCookies" >Block third party cookies</string>
			<string id="BlockThirdPartyCookies_Explain" >Enabling this setting prevents cookies from being set by web page elements that are not from the domain that is in the browser's address bar.

Disabling this setting allows cookies to be set by web page elements that are not from the domain that is in the browser's address bar and prevents users from changing this setting.

If this policy is left not set, third party cookies will be enabled but the user will be able to change that.</string>
			<string id="BookmarkBarEnabled" >Enable Bookmark Bar</string>
			<string id="BookmarkBarEnabled_Explain" >If you enable this setting, Google Chrome will show a bookmark bar.

If you disable this setting, users will never see the bookmark bar.

If you enable or disable this setting, users cannot change or override it in Google Chrome.

If this setting is left not set the user can decide to use this function or not.</string>
			<string id="BrowserAddPersonEnabled" >Enable add person in user manager</string>
			<string id="BrowserAddPersonEnabled_Explain" >If this policy is set to true or not configured, Google Chrome will allow Add Person from the user manager.

If this policy is set to false, Google Chrome will not allow creation of new profiles from the user manager.</string>
			<string id="BrowserGuestModeEnabled" >Enable guest mode in browser</string>
			<string id="BrowserGuestModeEnabled_Explain" >If this policy is set to true or not configured, Google Chrome will enable guest logins. Guest logins are Google Chrome profiles where all windows are in incognito mode.

If this policy is set to false, Google Chrome will not allow guest profiles to be started.</string>
			<string id="BrowserGuestModeEnforced" >Enforce browser guest mode</string>
			<string id="BrowserGuestModeEnforced_Explain" >If this policy is set to enabled, Google Chrome will enforce guest sessions and prevents profile logins. Guest logins are Google Chrome profiles where all windows are in incognito mode.

If this policy is set to disabled or not set or browser guest mode is disabled by BrowserGuestModeEnabled policy, Google Chrome will allow using new and existing profiles.</string>
			<string id="BrowserNetworkTimeQueriesEnabled" >Allow queries to a Google time service</string>
			<string id="BrowserNetworkTimeQueriesEnabled_Explain" >Setting this policy to false stops Google Chrome from occasionally sending queries to a Google server to retrieve an accurate timestamp. These queries will be enabled if this policy is set to True or is not set.</string>
			<string id="BrowserSignin" >Browser sign in settings</string>
			<string id="BrowserSignin_Explain" >This policy controls the sign-in behavior of the browser. It allows you to specify if the user can sign in to Google Chrome with their account and use account related services like Chrome sync.

If the policy is set to &quot;Disable browser sign-in&quot; then the user can not sign in to the browser and use account based services. In this case browser level features like Chrome sync can not be used and will be unavailable. If the user was signed in and the policy is set &quot;Disabled&quot; they will be signed out the next time they run Chrome but their local profile data like bookmarks, passwords etc. will stay preserved. The user will still be able to sign into and use Google web services like Gmail.

If the policy is set to &quot;Enable browser sign-in,&quot; then the user is allowed to sign in to the browser and is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services like Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means the user's account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that Chrome sync will be turned on per default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of Chrome sync, use the &quot;SyncDisabled&quot; policy.

If the policy is set to &quot;Force browser sign-in&quot; the user is presented with an account selection dialog and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser. This ensures that for managed accounts the policies associated with the account are applied and enforced. By default this turns on Chrome sync for the account, except for the case when sync was disabled by the domain admin or via the &quot;SyncDisabled&quot; policy. The default value of BrowserGuestModeEnabled will be set to false. Note that existing unsigned profiles will be locked and inaccessible after enabling this policy. For more information, see help center article: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7572556. This option does not support Linux and Android, it will fallback to &quot;Enable browser sign-in&quot; if used.

If this policy is not set then the user can decide if they want to enable the browser sign in option and use it as they see fit.</string>
			<string id="BrowserSignin_Disable" >Disable browser sign-in</string>
			<string id="BrowserSignin_Enable" >Enable browser sign-in</string>
			<string id="BrowserSignin_Force" >Force users to sign-in to use the browser</string>
			<string id="BuiltInDnsClientEnabled" >Use built-in DNS client</string>
			<string id="BuiltInDnsClientEnabled_Explain" >Controls whether the built-in DNS client is used in Google Chrome.

This does not affect which DNS servers are used; just the software stack which is used to communicate with them. For example if the operating system is configured to use an enterprise DNS server, that same server would be used by the built-in DNS client. It is however possible that the built-in DNS client will address servers in different ways by using more modern DNS-related protocols such as DNS-over-TLS.

If this policy is set to true, the built-in DNS client will be used, if available.

If this policy is set to false, the built-in DNS client will never be used.

If this policy is left not set, the built-in DNS client will be enabled by default on MacOS, Android (when neither Private DNS nor VPN are enabled) and ChromeOS, and the users will be able to change whether the built-in DNS client is used by editing chrome://flags or specifying a command-line flag.</string>
			<string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCas" >Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes</string>
			<string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCas_Explain" >Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes.

This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, one of the following conditions must be met:
1. The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.
2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the &quot;/&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is &quot;sha256&quot;.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.

Example value:

sha256/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==
sha256//////////////////////w==</string>
			<string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCas" >Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities</string>
			<string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCas_Explain" >Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities.

This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, the hash must be of a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognized as a Legacy Certificate Authority (CA). A Legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by default one or more operating systems supported by Google Chrome, but is not trusted by the Android Open Source Project or Google Chrome OS.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the &quot;/&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is &quot;sha256&quot;.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.

Example value:

sha256/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==
sha256//////////////////////w==</string>
			<string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls" >Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of URLs</string>
			<string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls_Explain" >Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements to the listed URLs.

This policy allows certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs to not be disclosed via Certificate Transparency. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used, but makes it harder to detect misissued certificates for those hosts.

A URL pattern is formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format. However, because certificates are valid for a given hostname independent of the scheme, port, or path, only the hostname portion of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.

			<string id="ChromeCleanupEnabled" >Enable Chrome Cleanup on Windows</string>
			<string id="ChromeCleanupEnabled_Explain" >If disabled, prevents Chrome Cleanup from scanning the system for unwanted software and performing cleanups. Manually triggering Chrome Cleanup from chrome://settings/cleanup is disabled.

If enabled or unset, Chrome Cleanup periodically scans the system for unwanted software and should any be found, will ask the user if they wish to remove it. Manually triggering Chrome Cleanup from chrome://settings is enabled.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain. or Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management.</string>
			<string id="ChromeCleanupReportingEnabled" >Control how Chrome Cleanup reports data to Google</string>
			<string id="ChromeCleanupReportingEnabled_Explain" >If unset, should Chrome Cleanup detect unwanted software, it may report metadata about the scan to Google in accordance with policy set by SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled. Chrome Cleanup will then ask the user if they wish to clean up the unwanted software. The user can choose to share results of the cleanup with Google to assist with future unwanted software detection. These results contain file metadata, automatically installed extensions and registry keys as described by the Chrome Privacy Whitepaper.

If disabled, should Chrome Cleanup detect unwanted software, it will not report metadata about the scan to Google, overriding any policy set by SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled. Chrome Cleanup will ask the user if they wish to clean up the unwanted software.  Results of the cleanup will not be reported to Google and the user will not have the option to do so.

If enabled, should Chrome Cleanup detect unwanted software, it may report metadata about the scan to Google in accordance with policy set by SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled. Chrome Cleanup will ask the user if they wish to clean up the unwanted software.  Results of the cleanup will be reported to Google and the user will not have the option to prevent it.

			<string id="ChromeVariations" >Determine the availability of variations</string>
			<string id="ChromeVariations_Explain" >Configuring this policy allows to specify which variations are allowed to be applied in Google Chrome.

Variations provide a mean for offering modifications to Google Chrome without shipping a new version of the browser by selectively enabling or disabling already existing features.

Setting the VariationsEnabled (value 0), or leaving the policy not set allows all variations to be applied to the browser.

Setting the CriticalFixesOnly (value 1), allows only variations considered critical security or stability fixes to be applied to Google Chrome.

Setting the VariationsDisabled (value 2), prevent all variations from being applied to the browser. Please note that this mode can potentially prevent the Google Chrome developers from providing critical security fixes in a timely manner and is thus not recommended.</string>

If you enable this setting, Google Chrome will always check on startup whether it is the default browser and automatically register itself if possible.

If this setting is disabled, Google Chrome will never check if it is the default browser and will disable user controls for setting this option.

If this setting is not set, Google Chrome will allow the user to control whether it is the default browser and whether user notifications should be shown when it isn't.

Note for administrators of Microsoft® Windows: Enabling this setting will only work for machines running Windows 7. For versions of Windows starting with Windows 8, you must deploy a &quot;default application associations&quot; file that makes Google Chrome the handler for the https and http protocols (and, optionally, the ftp protocol and file formats such as .html, .htm, .pdf, .svg, .webp, etc...).

When the 'Block potentially dangerous downloads' option is chosen, all downloads allowed, except for those that carry Safe Browsing warnings of potentially dangerous downloads.

When the 'Block all downloads' option is chosen, all downloads are blocked.

When the 'Block malicious downloads' option is chosen, all downloads are allowed, except for those that Safe Browsing assesses to be malware with high confidence. Unlike with dangerous downloads, this does not take into account file type, but does take into account the host.

When this policy is not set, (or the 'No special restrictions' option is chosen), the downloads will go through the usual security restrictions based on Safe Browsing analysis results.

If this policy is left not set, or the list is empty or does not match one of the supported string tags, all deprecated web platform features will remain disabled.

While the policy itself is supported on the above platforms, the feature it is enabling may be available on fewer platforms. Not all deprecated Web Platform features can be re-enabled. Only the ones explicitly listed below can be for a limited period of time, which is different per feature.

			<string id="GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled" >Enable globally scoped HTTP auth cache</string>
			<string id="GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled_Explain" >This policy configures a single global per profile cache with HTTP server authentication credentials.

If this policy is unset or disabled, the browser will use the default behavior of cross-site auth, which as of version 80, will be to scope HTTP server authentication credentials by top-level site, so if two sites use resources from the same authenticating domain, credentials will need to be provided independently in the context of both sites. Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

If the policy is enabled, HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another.

Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

This policy is intended to give enterprises depending on the legacy behavior a chance to update their login procedures, and will be removed in the future.</string>

			<string id="ManagedBookmarks" >Managed Bookmarks</string>
			<string id="ManagedBookmarks_Explain" >Configures a list of managed bookmarks.

The policy consists of a list of bookmarks whereas each bookmark is a dictionary containing the keys &quot;name&quot; and &quot;url&quot; which hold the bookmark's name and its target. A subfolder may be configured by defining a bookmark without an &quot;url&quot; key but with an additional &quot;children&quot; key which itself contains a list of bookmarks as defined above (some of which may be folders again). Google Chrome amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted via the Omnibox, for example &quot;google.com&quot; becomes &quot;https://google.com/&quot;.

These bookmarks are placed in a folder that can't be modified by the user (but the user can choose to hide it from the bookmark bar). By default the folder name is &quot;Managed bookmarks&quot; but it can be customized by adding to the list of bookmarks a dictionary containing the key &quot;toplevel_name&quot; with the desired folder name as the value.

Managed bookmarks are not synced to the user account and can't be modified by extensions.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ManagedBookmarks for more information about schema and formatting.

			<string id="MaxConnectionsPerProxy" >Maximal number of concurrent connections to the proxy server</string>
			<string id="MaxConnectionsPerProxy_Explain" >Specifies the maximal number of simultaneous connections to the proxy server.

Some proxy servers can not handle high number of concurrent connections per client and this can be solved by setting this policy to a lower value.

The value of this policy should be lower than 100 and higher than 6 and the default value is 32.

Some web apps are known to consume many connections with hanging GETs, so lowering below 32 may lead to browser networking hangs if too many such web apps are open. Lower below the default at your own risk.

If you disable this setting Google Chrome will not detect when a window is covered by other windows.

If this policy is left not set, occlusion detection will be enabled.</string>
			<string id="NetworkPredictionOptions" >Enable network prediction</string>
			<string id="NetworkPredictionOptions_Explain" >Enables network prediction in Google Chrome and prevents users from changing this setting.

This controls DNS prefetching, TCP and SSL preconnection and prerendering of web pages.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override this setting in Google Chrome.

If this policy is left not set, network prediction will be enabled but the user will be able to change it.</string>
			<string id="NetworkPredictionOptions_NetworkPredictionAlways" >Predict network actions on any network connection</string>
			<string id="NetworkPredictionOptions_NetworkPredictionWifiOnly" >Predict network actions on any network that is not cellular.

			<string id="NetworkPredictionOptions_NetworkPredictionNever" >Do not predict network actions on any network connection</string>
			<string id="OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin" >Origins or hostname patterns for which restrictions on
insecure origins should not apply</string>
			<string id="OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin_Explain" >The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such
as &quot;*.example.com&quot;) for which security restrictions on insecure origins
will not apply.

The intent is to allow organizations to set whitelist origins for legacy
applications that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server for
internal web development so that their developers can test out features
requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging
server. This policy will also prevent the origin from being labeled
&quot;Not Secure&quot; in the omnibox.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the
command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a
comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will
override the command-line flag.

This policy will override UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure, if present.

For more information on secure contexts, see
https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.

			<string id="PaymentMethodQueryEnabled" >Allow websites to query for available payment methods.</string>
			<string id="PaymentMethodQueryEnabled_Explain" >Allows you to set whether websites are allowed to check if the user has payment methods saved.

If this policy is set to disabled, websites that use PaymentRequest.canMakePayment or PaymentRequest.hasEnrolledInstrument API will be informed that no payment methods are available.

If the setting is enabled or not set then websites are allowed to check if the user has payment methods saved.</string>
			<string id="PolicyAtomicGroupsEnabled" >Enables the concept of policy atomic groups</string>
			<string id="PolicyAtomicGroupsEnabled_Explain" >If this policy is enabled, policies coming from the an atomic group that do not share the source with the highest priority from that group will be ignored.

If this policy is disabled, no policy will be ignored because of its source. Policies will be ignored only if there is a conflict and the policy does not have the highest priority.

If this policy ist set from a cloud source, it cannot target a specific user</string>
			<string id="PolicyDictionaryMultipleSourceMergeList" >Allow merging dictionary policies from different sources</string>
			<string id="PolicyDictionaryMultipleSourceMergeList_Explain" >Allows the selected policies to be merged when they come from different sources, with the same scopes and level.

The merging consists in merging the first level keys of the dictionary from each source. In case of conflict between keys, the key coming from the highest priority source will be applied.

If a policy is in the list, in case there is conflict between two sources, given that they have the same scopes and level, the values will be merged into a new policy dictionary.

If a policy is in the list, in case there is conflict between two sources but also between different scopes and/or level, the policy with the highest priority will be applied.

If a policy is not in the list, in case there is any conflict between sources, scopes and/or level, the policy with the highest priority will be applied.

			<string id="PolicyRefreshRate" >Refresh rate for user policy</string>
			<string id="PolicyRefreshRate_Explain" >Specifies the period in milliseconds at which the device management service is queried for user policy information.

Setting this policy overrides the default value of 3 hours. Valid values for this policy are in the range from 1800000 (30 minutes) to 86400000 (1 day). Any values not in this range will be clamped to the respective boundary. If the platform supports policy notifications, the refresh delay will be set to 24 hours because it is expected that policy notifications will force a refresh automatically whenever policy changes.

Leaving this policy not set will make Google Chrome use the default value of 3 hours.

Note that if the platform supports policy notifications, the refresh delay will be set to 24 hours (ignoring all defaults and the value of this policy) because it is expected that policy notifications will force a refresh automatically whenever policy changes, making more frequent refreshes unnecessary.</string>
			<string id="PromotionalTabsEnabled" >Enable showing full-tab promotional content</string>
			<string id="PromotionalTabsEnabled_Explain" >Allows you to control the presentation of full-tab promotional and/or educational content in Google Chrome.

If not configured or enabled (set to true), Google Chrome may show full-tab content to users to provide product information.

If disabled (set to false), Google Chrome will not show full-tab content to users to provide product information.

This setting controls the presentation of the welcome pages that help users sign into Google Chrome, choose it as their default browser, or otherwise inform them of product features.</string>
			<string id="PromptForDownloadLocation" >Ask where to save each file before downloading</string>
			<string id="PromptForDownloadLocation_Explain" >If the policy is enabled, the user will be asked where to save each file before downloading.

			<string id="ProxySettings" >Proxy settings</string>
			<string id="ProxySettings_Explain" >Configures the proxy settings for Google Chrome. These proxy settings will be available for ARC-apps too.

If you enable this setting, Google Chrome and ARC-apps ignore all proxy-related options specified from the command line.

Leaving this policy not set will allow the users to choose the proxy settings on their own.

If the ProxySettings policy is set, it will override any of the individual policies ProxyMode, ProxyPacUrl, ProxyServer, ProxyBypassList and ProxyServerMode.

The ProxyMode field allows you to specify the proxy server used by Google Chrome and prevents users from changing proxy settings.

The ProxyPacUrl field is a URL to a proxy .pac file.

The ProxyServer field is a URL of the proxy server.

The ProxyBypassList field is a list of proxy hosts that Google Chrome will bypass.

The ProxyServerMode field is deprecated in favor of the field 'ProxyMode'. It allows you to specify the proxy server used by Google Chrome and prevents users from changing proxy settings.

If you choose the value 'direct' as 'ProxyMode', a proxy will never be used and all other fields will be ignored.

If you choose the value 'system' as 'ProxyMode', the systems's proxy will be used and all other fields will be ignored.

If you choose the value 'auto_detect' as 'ProxyMode', all other fields will be ignored.

If you choose the value 'fixed_server' as 'ProxyMode', the 'ProxyServer' and 'ProxyBypassList' fields will be used.

If you choose the value 'pac_script' as 'ProxyMode', the 'ProxyPacUrl' and 'ProxyBypassList' fields will be used.

			<string id="RelaunchNotification" >Notify a user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required</string>
			<string id="RelaunchNotification_Explain" >Notify users that Google Chrome must be relaunched or Google Chrome OS must be restarted to apply a pending update.

This policy setting enables notifications to inform the user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required. If not set, Google Chrome indicates to the user that a relaunch is needed via subtle changes to its menu, while Google Chrome OS indicates such via a notification in the system tray. If set to 'Recommended', a recurring warning will be shown to the user that a relaunch is recommended. The user can dismiss this warning to defer the relaunch. If set to 'Required', a recurring warning will be shown to the user indicating that a browser relaunch will be forced once the notification period passes. The default period is seven days for Google Chrome and four days for Google Chrome OS, and may be configured via the RelaunchNotificationPeriod policy setting.

The user's session is restored following the relaunch/restart.</string>
			<string id="RelaunchNotification_Recommended" >Show a recurring prompt to the user indicating that a relaunch is recommended</string>
			<string id="RelaunchNotification_Required" >Show a recurring prompt to the user indicating that a relaunch is required</string>
			<string id="RelaunchNotificationPeriod" >Set the time period for update notifications</string>
			<string id="RelaunchNotificationPeriod_Explain" >Allows you to set the time period, in milliseconds, over which users are notified that Google Chrome must be relaunched or that a Google Chrome OS device must be restarted to apply a pending update.

Over this time period, the user will be repeatedly informed of the need for an update. For Google Chrome OS devices, a restart notification appears in the system tray according to the RelaunchHeadsUpPeriod policy. For Google Chrome browsers, the app menu changes to indicate that a relaunch is needed once one third of the notification period passes. This notification changes color once two thirds of the notification period passes, and again once the full notification period has passed. The additional notifications enabled by the RelaunchNotification policy follow this same schedule.

If not set, the default period of 604800000 milliseconds (one week) is used.</string>
			<string id="RendererCodeIntegrityEnabled" >Enable Renderer Code Integrity</string>
			<string id="RendererCodeIntegrityEnabled_Explain" >If this policy is enabled or left unset, then Renderer Code Integrity is enabled. This should only be disabled if compatibility issues are encountered with third party software that must run inside Chrome's renderer processes.

Disabling this policy has a detrimental effect on Chrome's security and stability as unknown and potentially hostile code will be allowed to load inside Chrome's renderer processes. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md#Process-mitigation-policies for more info.</string>
			<string id="RequireOnlineRevocationChecksForLocalAnchors" >Require online OCSP/CRL checks for local trust anchors</string>
			<string id="RequireOnlineRevocationChecksForLocalAnchors_Explain" >When this setting is enabled, Google Chrome will always perform revocation checking for server certificates that successfully validate and are signed by locally-installed CA certificates.

If Google Chrome is unable to obtain revocation status information, such certificates will be treated as revoked ('hard-fail').

If this policy is not set, or it is set to false, then Google Chrome will use the existing online revocation checking settings.</string>
			<string id="RestrictSigninToPattern" >Restrict which Google accounts are allowed to be set as browser primary accounts in Google Chrome</string>
			<string id="RestrictSigninToPattern_Explain" >Contains a regular expression which is used to determine which Google accounts can be set as browser primary accounts in Google Chrome (i.e. the account that is chosen during the Sync opt-in flow).

An appropriate error is displayed if a user tries to set a browser primary account with a username that does not match this pattern.

If this policy is left not set or blank, then the user can set any Google account as a browser primary account in Google Chrome.

Example value: .*@example.com</string>
			<string id="RoamingProfileLocation" >Set the roaming profile directory</string>
			<string id="RoamingProfileLocation_Explain" >Configures the directory that Google Chrome will use for storing the roaming copy of the profiles.

If you set this policy, Google Chrome will use the provided directory to store the roaming copy of the profiles if the RoamingProfileSupportEnabled policy has been enabled. If the RoamingProfileSupportEnabled policy is disabled or left unset the value stored in this policy is not used.

See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables for a list of variables that can be used.

If this policy is left not set the default roaming profile path will be used.

Example value: ${roaming_app_data}\chrome-profile</string>
			<string id="RoamingProfileSupportEnabled" >Enable the creation of roaming copies for Google Chrome profile data</string>
			<string id="RoamingProfileSupportEnabled_Explain" >If you enable this setting, the settings stored in Google Chrome profiles like bookmarks, autofill data, passwords, etc. will also be written to a file stored in the Roaming user profile folder or a location specified by the Administrator through the RoamingProfileLocation policy. Enabling this policy disables cloud sync.

If this policy is disabled or left not set only the regular local profiles will be used.

The SyncDisabled policy disables all data synchronization, overriding RoamingProfileSupportEnabled.</string>

			<string id="RunAllFlashInAllowMode_Explain" >If you enable this setting, all Flash content embedded on websites that have been set to allow Flash in content settings -- either by the user or by enterprise policy -- will be run, including content from other origins or small content.

To control which websites are allowed to run Flash, see the &quot;DefaultPluginsSetting&quot;, &quot;PluginsAllowedForUrls&quot;, and &quot;PluginsBlockedForUrls&quot; policies.

If this setting is disabled or not set, Flash content from other origins or small content might be blocked.</string>
			<string id="SSLErrorOverrideAllowed" >Allow proceeding from the SSL warning page</string>
			<string id="SSLErrorOverrideAllowed_Explain" >Chrome shows a warning page when users navigate to sites that have SSL errors. By default or when this policy is set to true, users are allowed to click through these warning pages.
Setting this policy to false disallows users to click through any warning page.</string>
			<string id="SSLVersionMin" >Minimum SSL version enabled</string>
			<string id="SSLVersionMin_Explain" >If this policy is not configured then Google Chrome uses a default minimum version which is TLS 1.0.

Otherwise it may be set to one of the following values: &quot;tls1&quot;, &quot;tls1.1&quot; or &quot;tls1.2&quot;. When set, Google Chrome will not use SSL/TLS versions less than the specified version. An unrecognized value will be ignored.

Additionally, a signal will be sent to the Security Key indicating that individual attestation may be used. Without this, users will be prompted in Chrome 65+ when sites request attestation of Security Keys.

URLs (like https://example.com/some/path) will only match as U2F appIDs. Domains (like example.com) only match as webauthn RP IDs. Thus, to cover both U2F and webauthn APIs for a given site, both the appID URL and domain would need to be listed.

			<string id="SitePerProcess" >Enable Site Isolation for every site</string>
			<string id="SitePerProcess_Explain" >This setting, SitePerProcess, may be used to disallow users from opting out of the default behavior of isolating all sites. Note that the IsolateOrigins policy may also be useful for isolating additional, finer-grained origins.
If the policy is enabled, users will be unable to opt out of the default behavior where each site runs in its own process.
If the policy is not configured or disabled, the user will be able to opt out of site isolation
(e.g. using &quot;Disable site isolation&quot; entry in chrome://flags).  Setting the policy to disabled and/or not configuring the policy does not turn off Site Isolation.
On Google Chrome OS version 76 and earlier, it is recommended to also set the DeviceLoginScreenSitePerProcess device policy to the same value. If the values specified by the two policies don't match, a delay may be incurred when entering a user session while the value specified by user policy is being applied.

If this policy is set to true, spellcheck is enabled and the user cannot disable it. On Microsoft® Windows, Google Chrome OS and Linux, spellcheck languages can be individually toggled on or off, so the user can still effectively disable spellcheck by toggling off every spellcheck language. To avoid that, the SpellcheckLanguage policy can be used to force specific spellcheck languages to be enabled.

If this policy is set to false, spellcheck is disabled and the user cannot enable it. The SpellcheckLanguage and SpellcheckLanguageBlacklist policies have no effect when this policy is set to false.</string>
			<string id="SpellcheckLanguage" >Force enable spellcheck languages</string>

If you enable this setting, users cannot change or override this setting in Google Chrome.

If this policy is left not set Google Sync will be available for the user to choose whether to use it or not.

To fully disable Google Sync, it is recommended that you disable the Google Sync service in the Google Admin console.

This policy should not be enabled when RoamingProfileSupportEnabled policy is set to enabled as that feature shares the same client side functionality. The Google-hosted synchronization is disabled in this case completely.</string>
			<string id="SyncTypesListDisabled" >List of types that should be excluded from synchronization</string>
			<string id="SyncTypesListDisabled_Explain" >If this policy is set all specified data types will be excluded from synchronization both for Google Sync as well as for roaming profile synchronization. This can be beneficial to reduce the size of the roaming profile or limit the type of data uploaded to the Google Sync Servers.

The current data types for this policy are: &quot;bookmarks&quot;, &quot;preferences&quot;, &quot;passwords&quot;, &quot;autofill&quot;, &quot;themes&quot;, &quot;typedUrls&quot;, &quot;extensions&quot;, &quot;apps&quot;, &quot;tabs&quot;, &quot;wifiConfiguration&quot;.

			<string id="TLS13HardeningForLocalAnchorsEnabled_Explain" >This policy controls a security feature in TLS 1.3 which protects connections against downgrade attacks. It is backwards-compatible and will not affect connections to compliant TLS 1.2 servers or proxies. However, older versions of some TLS-intercepting proxies have an implementation flaw which causes them to be incompatible.

If this policy is set to True or not set, Google Chrome will enable these security protections for all connections.

If this policy is set to False, Google Chrome will disable these security protections for connections authenticated with locally-installed CA certificates. These protections are always enabled for connections authenticated with publicly-trusted CA certificates.

The default value for this policy was changed in Google Chrome 81 from false to true. Affected proxies are expected to fail connections with an error code of ERR_TLS13_DOWNGRADE_DETECTED. Administrators who need more time to upgrade affected proxies may use this policy to temporarily disable this security feature. This policy will be removed after version 85.</string>

If the policy is set, browser will begin to discard tabs to save memory once the limitation is exceeded. However, there is no guarantee that the browser is always running under the limit. Any value under 1024 will be rounded up to 1024.

If this policy is not set, the browser will only begin attempts to save memory once it has detected that the amount of physical memory on its machine is low.</string>
			<string id="TranslateEnabled" >Enable Translate</string>
			<string id="TranslateEnabled_Explain" >Enables the integrated Google Translate service on Google Chrome.

If you enable this setting, Google Chrome will offer translation functionality to the user by showing an integrated translate toolbar (when appropriate) and a translate option on the right-click context menu.

If you disable this setting, all built-in translate features will be disabled.

If you enable or disable this setting, users cannot change or override this setting in Google Chrome.

If this setting is left not set the user can decide to use this function or not.</string>
			<string id="URLBlacklist" >Block access to a list of URLs</string>
			<string id="URLBlacklist_Explain" >This policy prevents the user from loading web pages from blacklisted URLs. The blacklist provides a list of URL patterns that specify which URLs will be blacklisted.

A URL pattern has to be formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format.

Exceptions can be defined in the URL whitelist policy. These policies are limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries will be ignored.

Note that it is not recommended to block internal 'chrome://*' URLs since this may lead to unexpected errors.

From M73 you can block 'javascript://*' URLs. However, it affects only JavaScript typed in address bar (or, for example, bookmarklets). Note that in-page JavaScript URLs, as long as dynamically loaded data, are not subject to this policy. For example, if you block 'example.com/abc', page 'example.com' will still be able to load 'example.com/abc' via XMLHTTPRequest.

If this policy is not set no URL will be blacklisted in the browser.

Example value:

example.com
https://ssl.server.com
hosting.com/bad_path
https://server:8080/path
.exact.hostname.com
file://*
custom_scheme:*
*</string>
			<string id="URLWhitelist" >Allow access to a list of URLs</string>
			<string id="URLWhitelist_Explain" >Allows access to the listed URLs, as exceptions to the URL blacklist.

See the description of the URL blacklist policy for the format of entries of this list.

This policy can be used to open exceptions to restrictive blacklists. For example, '*' can be blacklisted to block all requests, and this policy can be used to allow access to a limited list of URLs. It can be used to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths.

The most specific filter will determine if a URL is blocked or allowed. The whitelist takes precedence over the blacklist.

This policy is limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries will be ignored.

If this policy is not set there will be no exceptions to the blacklist from the 'URLBlacklist' policy.

Example value:

example.com
https://ssl.server.com
hosting.com/good_path
https://server:8080/path
.exact.hostname.com</string>
			<string id="UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled" >Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection</string>
			<string id="UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled_Explain" >Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection in Google Chrome and prevents users from changing this setting.

URL-keyed anonymized data collection sends URLs of pages the user visits to Google to make searches and browsing better.

If you enable this policy, URL-keyed anonymized data collection is always active.

If you disable this policy, URL-keyed anonymized data collection is never active.

If this policy is left not set, URL-keyed anonymized data collection will be enabled but the user will be able to change it.</string>
			<string id="UseLegacyFormControls" >Use Legacy Form Controls until M84.</string>

This policy restores the old &quot;legacy&quot; form control elements until M84.

     If this policy is set to True, the &quot;legacy&quot; form control elements will be used for all sites.

     If this policy is set to False or not set, the form control elements will be enabled as they are launched in M81, M82, and M83.

     This policy will be removed after Chrome 84.</string>
			<string id="UserDataDir" >Set user data directory</string>
			<string id="UserDataDir_Explain" >Configures the directory that Google Chrome will use for storing user data.

If you set this policy, Google Chrome will use the provided directory regardless whether the user has specified the '--user-data-dir' flag or not. To avoid data loss or other unexpected errors this policy should not be set to a directory used for other purposes, because Google Chrome manages its contents.

See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables for a list of variables that can be used.

If this policy is left not set the default profile path will be used and the user will be able to override it with the '--user-data-dir' command line flag.

Example value: ${users}/${user_name}/Chrome</string>
			<string id="UserDataSnapshotRetentionLimit" >Limits the number of user data snapshots retained for use in case of emergency rollback.</string>
			<string id="UserDataSnapshotRetentionLimit_Explain" >Following each major version update, Chrome will create a snapshot of certain portions of the user's browsing data for use in case of a later emergency version rollback. If an emergency rollback is performed to a version for which a user has a corresponding snapshot, the data in the snapshot is restored. This allows users to retain such settings as bookmarks and autofill data.

If this policy is not set, the default value of 3 is used

If the policy is set, old snapshots are deleted as needed to respect the limit. If the policy is set to 0, no snapshots will be taken</string>
			<string id="UserFeedbackAllowed" >Allow user feedback</string>
			<string id="UserFeedbackAllowed_Explain" >Allow user feedback.

			<string id="VideoCaptureAllowed" >Allow or deny video capture</string>
			<string id="VideoCaptureAllowed_Explain" >If enabled or not configured (default), the user will be prompted for
video capture access except for URLs configured in the
VideoCaptureAllowedUrls list which will be granted access without prompting.

When this policy is disabled, the user will never be prompted and video
capture only be available to URLs configured in VideoCaptureAllowedUrls.

This policy affects all types of video inputs and not only the built-in camera.</string>
			<string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrls" >URLs that will be granted access to video capture devices without prompt</string>
			<string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrls_Explain" >Patterns in this list will be matched against the security

			<string id="WPADQuickCheckEnabled" >Enable WPAD optimization</string>
			<string id="WPADQuickCheckEnabled_Explain" >Allows to turn off WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) optimization in Google Chrome.

If this policy is set to false, WPAD optimization is disabled causing Google Chrome to wait longer for DNS-based WPAD servers.  If the policy is not set or is enabled, WPAD optimization is enabled.

Independent of whether or how this policy is set, the WPAD optimization setting cannot be changed by users.</string>
			<string id="WebAppInstallForceList" >Configure list of force-installed Web Apps</string>
			<string id="WebAppInstallForceList_Explain" >Specifies a list of websites that are installed silently, without user interaction, and which cannot be uninstalled nor disabled by the user.

Each list item of the policy is an object with a mandatory member: &quot;url&quot; and two optional members: &quot;default_launch_container&quot; and &quot;create_desktop_shortcut&quot;. &quot;url&quot; should be the URL of the web app to install, &quot;launch_container&quot; should be either &quot;window&quot; or &quot;tab&quot; to indicate how the Web App will be opened once installed, and &quot;create_desktop_shortcut&quot; should be true if a desktop shortcut should be created on Linux and Windows. If &quot;default_launch_container&quot; is omitted, the app will open in a tab by default. Regardless of the value of &quot;default_launch_container&quot;, users are able to change which container the app will open in. If &quot;create_desktop_shortcuts&quot; is omitted, no desktop shortcuts will be created. See PinnedLauncherApps policy for pinning apps to the ChromeOS shelf.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=WebAppInstallForceList for more information about schema and formatting.

			<string id="WebComponentsV0Enabled" >Re-enable Web Components v0 API until M84.</string>
			<string id="WebComponentsV0Enabled_Explain" >The Web Components v0 APIs (Shadow DOM v0, Custom Elements v0, and HTML Imports) were deprecated in 2018, and have been disabled by default starting in M80. This policy allows these features to be selectively re-enabled until M84.

     If this policy is set to True, the Web Components v0 features will be enabled for all sites.

     If this policy is set to False or not set, the Web Components v0 features will be disabled by default, starting in M80.

     This policy will be removed after Chrome 84.</string>
			<string id="WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed" >Allow collection of WebRTC event logs from Google services</string>
			<string id="WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed_Explain" >Setting the policy to True allows Google Chrome to collect WebRTC event logs from Google services such as Hangouts Meet and upload them to Google. These logs have diagnostic information for debugging issues with audio or video meetings in Google Chrome, such as the time and size of RTP packets, feedback about congestion on the network, and metadata about time and quality of audio and video frames. These logs have no audio or video content from the meeting. To make debugging easier, Google might associate these logs, by means of a session ID, with other logs collected by the Google service itself.

Setting the policy to False results in no collection or uploading of such logs.

Leaving the policy unset on versions up to and including M76 means Google Chrome defaults to not being able to collect and upload these logs. Starting at M77, Google Chrome defaults to being able to collect and upload these logs from most profiles affected by cloud-based user-level enterprise policies. From M77 up to and including M80, Google Chrome can also collect and upload these logs by default from profiles affected by Google Chrome on-premise management.</string>
			<string id="WebRtcLocalIpsAllowedUrls" >URLs for which local IPs are exposed in WebRTC ICE candidates</string>

Independent of the filter, only certificates will be selected that match the server's certificate request. For example, if $FILTER has the form { &quot;ISSUER&quot;: { &quot;CN&quot;: &quot;$ISSUER_CN&quot; } }, additionally only client certificates are selected that are issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN. If $FILTER contains an &quot;ISSUER&quot; and a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section, a client certificate must satisfy both conditions to be selected. If $FILTER specifies an organization (&quot;O&quot;), a certificate must have at least one organization which matches the specified value to be selected. If $FILTER specifies an organization unit (&quot;OU&quot;), a certificate must have at least one organization unit which matches the specified value to be selected. If $FILTER is the empty dictionary {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted.

If this policy is left not set, no auto-selection will be done for any site.

			<string id="WebUsbAllowDevicesForUrls" >Automatically grant permission to these sites to connect to USB devices with the given vendor and product IDs.</string>
			<string id="WebUsbAllowDevicesForUrls_Explain" >Allows you to set a list of urls that specify which sites will automatically be granted permission to access a USB device with the given vendor and product IDs. Each item in the list must contain both devices and urls in order for the policy to be valid. Each item in devices can contain a vendor ID and product ID field. Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified. Otherwise, the policy will not be valid and will be ignored.

The USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site (&quot;requesting URL&quot;) and the URL of the top-level frame site (&quot;embedding URL&quot;) to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the &quot;urls&quot; field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices will be granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL regardless of embedding status. The URLs in &quot;urls&quot; must be valid URLs, otherwise the policy will be ignored.

If this policy is left not set, the global default value will be used for all sites either from the 'DefaultWebUsbGuardSetting' policy if it is set, or the user's personal configuration otherwise.

URL patterns in this policy should not clash with the ones configured via WebUsbBlockedForUrls. If there is a clash, this policy will take precedence over WebUsbBlockedForUrls and WebUsbAskForUrls.

			<string id="ExtensionInstallBlacklist" >Configure extension installation blacklist</string>
			<string id="ExtensionInstallBlacklist_Explain" >Allows you to specify which extensions the users can NOT install. Extensions already installed will be disabled if blacklisted, without a way for the user to enable them. Once an extension disabled due to the blacklist is removed from it, it will automatically get re-enabled.

A blacklist value of '*' means all extensions are blacklisted unless they are explicitly listed in the whitelist.

If this policy is left not set the user can install any extension in Google Chrome.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string>
			<string id="ExtensionInstallWhitelist" >Configure extension installation whitelist</string>
			<string id="ExtensionInstallWhitelist_Explain" >Allows you to specify which extensions are not subject to the blacklist.

A blacklist value of * means all extensions are blacklisted and users can only install extensions listed in the whitelist.

By default, all extensions are whitelisted, but if all extensions have been blacklisted by policy, the whitelist can be used to override that policy.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string>
			<string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist" >Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string>
			<string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist_Explain" >Specifies a list of apps and extensions that are installed silently,
without user interaction, and which cannot be uninstalled nor
disabled by the user. All permissions requested by the
apps/extensions are granted implicitly, without user interaction,
including any additional permissions requested by future versions of
the app/extension. Furthermore, permissions are granted for the
enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension
APIs. (These two APIs are not available to apps/extensions that are
not force-installed.)

This policy takes precedence over a potentially conflicting ExtensionInstallBlacklist policy. If an app or extension that previously had been force-installed is removed from this list, it is automatically uninstalled by Google Chrome.

For Windows instances that are not joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

Note that the source code of any extension may be altered by users via Developer Tools (potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional). If this is a concern, the DeveloperToolsDisabled policy should be set.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an &quot;update&quot; URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on chrome://extensions when in developer mode. The &quot;update&quot; URL, if specified, should point to an Update Manifest XML document as described at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate. By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used (which currently is &quot;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx&quot;). Note that the &quot;update&quot; URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension employ the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest. Note also that specifying the &quot;update&quot; URL explicitly was mandatory in Google Chrome versions up to and including 67.

For example, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx installs the extension with id aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa from the standard Chrome Web Store &quot;update&quot; URL. For more information about hosting extensions, see: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting.

If this policy is left not set, no apps or extensions are installed automatically and the user can uninstall any app or extension in Google Chrome.

Note that this policy doesn't apply to incognito mode.

Example value:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx
abcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop</string>
			<string id="ExtensionInstallSources" >Configure extension, app, and user script install sources</string>
			<string id="ExtensionInstallSources_Explain" >Allows you to specify which URLs are allowed to install extensions, apps, and themes.

Starting in Google Chrome 21, it is more difficult to install extensions, apps, and user scripts from outside the Chrome Web Store. Previously, users could click on a link to a *.crx file, and Google Chrome would offer to install the file after a few warnings. After Google Chrome 21, such files must be downloaded and dragged onto the Google Chrome settings page. This setting allows specific URLs to have the old, easier installation flow.

Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns). Users will be able to easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (i.e. the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns.

ExtensionInstallBlacklist takes precedence over this policy. That is, an extension on the blacklist won't be installed, even if it happens from a site on this list.

Example value:

https://corp.mycompany.com/*</string>
			<string id="ExtensionAllowedTypes" >Configure allowed app/extension types</string>
			<string id="ExtensionAllowedTypes_Explain" >Controls which app/extension types are allowed to be installed and limits runtime access.

This setting white-lists the allowed types of extension/apps that can be installed in Google Chrome and which hosts they can interact with. The value is a list of strings, each of which should be one of the following: &quot;extension&quot;, &quot;theme&quot;, &quot;user_script&quot;, &quot;hosted_app&quot;, &quot;legacy_packaged_app&quot;, &quot;platform_app&quot;. See the Google Chrome extensions documentation for more information on these types.

Note that this policy also affects extensions and apps to be force-installed via ExtensionInstallForcelist.

If this setting is configured, extensions/apps which have a type that is not on the list will not be installed.

If this settings is left not-configured, no restrictions on the acceptable extension/app types are enforced.

Prior to version 75 using multiple comma separated extension IDs is not supported and will be skipped. The rest of the policy will continue to apply.

Example value:

hosted_app</string>
			<string id="ExtensionSettings" >Extension management settings</string>
			<string id="ExtensionSettings_Explain" >Configures extension management settings for Google Chrome.

This policy controls multiple settings, including settings controlled by any existing extension-related policies. This policy will override any legacy policies if both are set.

This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its configuration. With an extension ID, configuration will be applied to the specified extension only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID &quot;*&quot;, which will apply to all extensions that don't have a custom configuration set in this policy. With an update URL, configuration will be applied to all extensions with the exact update URL stated in manifest of this extension, as described at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate.

For Windows instances that are not joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

When this policy is set to one of ${ie}, ${firefox}, ${safari} or
${opera}, that browser will launch if it is installed. ${ie} is only

When this policy is set to a list of strings, each string is passed to the alternative browser as a separate command-line parameters. On Windows, the parameters are joined with spaces. On Mac OS X and Linux, a parameter may contain spaces, and still be treated as a single parameter.

If an element contains ${url}, it gets replaced with the URL of the page to open.

If no element contains ${url}, the URL is appended at the end of the command line.

Environment variables are expanded. On Windows, %ABC% is replaced with the value of the ABC environment variable. On Mac OS X and Linux, ${ABC} is replaced with the value of the ABC environment variable.

			<string id="BrowserSwitcherEnabled" >Enable the Legacy Browser Support feature.</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherEnabled_Explain" >This policy controls whether to enable Legacy Browser Support.

When this policy is left unset, or is set to false, Chrome will not attempt to launch designated URLs in an alternate browser.

When this policy is set to true, Chrome will attempt to launch some URLs in an alternate browser (such as Internet Explorer). This feature is configured using the policies in the Legacy Browser support group.

This feature is a replacement for the 'Legacy Browser Support' extension. Configuration from the extension will carry over to this feature, but it is strongly advised to use the Chrome policies instead. This ensures better compatibility in the future.</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherExternalSitelistUrl" >URL of an XML file that contains URLs to load in an alternative browser.</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherExternalSitelistUrl_Explain" >This policy is a URL, that points to an XML file in the same format as Internet Explorer's SiteList policy. This loads rules from an XML file, without sharing those rules with Internet Explorer.

When this policy is left unset, or not set to a valid URL, Google Chrome does not use it as a source of rules for switching browsers.

When this policy is set to a valid URL, Google Chrome downloads the site list from that URL, and applies the rules as if they had been configured with the BrowserSwitcherUrlList policy.

For more information on Internet Explorer's SiteList policy: https://docs.microsoft.com/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/what-is-enterprise-mode

Example value: http://example.com/sitelist.xml</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherExternalGreylistUrl" >URL of an XML file that contains URLs that should never trigger a browser switch.</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherExternalGreylistUrl_Explain" >This policy is a URL, that points to an XML file in the same format as Internet Explorer's SiteList policy. This loads rules from an XML file, without sharing those rules with Internet Explorer.

The rules in this XML file apply in the same way as BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist. That is, these rules prevent Google Chrome from opening the alternative browser, and also prevent the alternative browser from opening Google Chrome.

When this policy is left unset, or not set to a valid URL, Google Chrome does not use it as a source of rules that don't trigger a browser switch.

When this policy is set to a valid URL, Google Chrome downloads the site list from that URL, and applies the rules as if they had been configured with the BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist policy.

			<string id="BrowserSwitcherKeepLastChromeTab" >Keep last tab open in Chrome.</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherKeepLastChromeTab_Explain" >This policy controls whether to close Chrome completely when the last tab would switch to another browser.

When this policy is left unset, or is set to true, Chrome will keep at least one tab open, after switching to an alternate browser.

When this policy is set to false, Chrome will close the tab after switching to an alternate browser, even if it was the last tab. This will cause Chrome to exit completely.</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherUrlList" >Websites to open in alternative browser</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherUrlList_Explain" >This policy controls the list of websites to open in an alternative browser.

Note that elements can also be added to this list through the BrowserSwitcherUseIeSitelist and BrowserSwitcherExternalSitelistUrl policies.

When this policy is left unset, no websites are added to the list.

When this policy is set, each item is treated as a rule for something to open in an alternative browser. Google Chrome uses those rules when choosing if a URL should open in an alternative browser.

When the Internet Explorer add-in is present and enabled, Internet Explorer switches back to Google Chrome when the rules do not match.

If rules contradict eachother, Google Chrome uses the most specific rule.

Example value:

ie.com
!open-in-chrome.ie.com
foobar.com/ie-only/</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist" >Websites that should never trigger a browser switch.</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist_Explain" >This policy controls the list of websites that will never cause a browser switch.

Note that elements can also be added to this list through the BrowserSwitcherExternalGreylistUrl policy.

When this policy is left unset, no websites are added to the list.

When this policy is set, each item is treated as a rule, similar to the BrowserSwitcherUrlList policy. However, the logic is reversed: rules that match will not open an alternative browser.

Unlike BrowserSwitcherUrlList, rules apply to both directions. That is, when the Internet Explorer add-in is present and enabled, it also controls whether Internet Explorer should open these URLs in Google Chrome.

Example value:

ie.com
!open-in-chrome.ie.com
foobar.com/ie-only/</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherUseIeSitelist" >Use Internet Explorer's SiteList policy for Legacy Browser Support.</string>
			<string id="BrowserSwitcherUseIeSitelist_Explain" >This policy controls whether to load rules from Internet Explorer's SiteList policy.

When this policy is left unset, or set to false, Google Chrome does not use Internet Explorer's SiteList policy as a source of rules for switching browsers.

When this policy is set to true, Google Chrome reads Internet Explorer's SiteList to obtain the site list's URL. Google Chrome then downloads the site list from that URL, and applies the rules as if they had been configured with the BrowserSwitcherUrlList policy.

			<string id="NativeMessagingBlacklist" >Configure native messaging blacklist</string>
			<string id="NativeMessagingBlacklist_Explain" >Allows you to specify which native messaging hosts that should not be loaded.

A blacklist value of '*' means all native messaging hosts are blacklisted unless they are explicitly listed in the whitelist.

If this policy is left not set Google Chrome will load all installed native messaging hosts.

Example value:

com.native.messaging.host.name1
com.native.messaging.host.name2</string>
			<string id="NativeMessagingWhitelist" >Configure native messaging whitelist</string>
			<string id="NativeMessagingWhitelist_Explain" >Allows you to specify which native messaging hosts are not subject to the blacklist.

A blacklist value of * means all native messaging hosts are blacklisted and only native messaging hosts listed in the whitelist will be loaded.

By default, all native messaging hosts are whitelisted, but if all native messaging hosts have been blacklisted by policy, the whitelist can be used to override that policy.

Example value:

This policy determines the rules for selecting the default printer in Google Chrome which happens the first time the print function is used with a profile.

When this policy is set, Google Chrome will attempt to find a printer matching all of the specified attributes, and select it as default printer. The first printer found matching the policy is selected, in case of non-unique match any matching printer can be selected, depending on the order printers are discovered.

If this policy is not set or matching printer is not found within the timeout, the printer defaults to built-in PDF printer or no printer selected, when PDF printer is not available.

Printers connected to Google Cloud Print are considered &quot;cloud&quot;, the rest of the printers are classified as &quot;local&quot;.
Omitting a field means all values match, for example, not specifying connectivity will cause Print Preview to initiate the discovery of all kinds of printers, local and cloud.
Regular expression patterns must follow the JavaScript RegExp syntax and matches are case sensistive.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=DefaultPrinterSelection for more information about schema and formatting.

			<string id="PrintPreviewUseSystemDefaultPrinter" >Use System Default Printer as Default</string>
			<string id="PrintPreviewUseSystemDefaultPrinter_Explain" >Causes Google Chrome to use the system default printer as the default choice in Print Preview instead of the most recently used printer.

If you disable this setting or do not set a value, Print Preview will use the most recently used printer as the default destination choice.

If you enable this setting, Print Preview will use the OS system default printer as the default destination choice.</string>
			<string id="PrinterTypeDenyList" >Disable printer types on the deny list</string>
			<string id="PrinterTypeDenyList_Explain" >The printers of types placed on the deny list will be disabled from being discovered or having their capabilities fetched.

Placing all printer types on the deny list effectively disables printing, as there would be no available destinations to send a document for printing.

Including cloud on the deny list has the same effect as setting the CloudPrintSubmitEnabled policy to false. In order to keep Google Cloud Print destinations discoverable, the CloudPrintSubmitEnabled policy must be set to true and cloud must not be on the deny list.

If the policy is not set, or is set to an empty list, all printer types will be available for discovery.

Extension printers are also known as print provider destinations, and include any destination that belongs to a Google Chrome extension.

Local printers are also known as native printing destinations, and include destinations available to the local machine and shared network printers.

When printing to a non-PostScript printer on Windows, sometimes print jobs need to be rasterized to print correctly.

When this policy is set to Full, Google Chrome will do full page rasterization if necessary.

When this policy is set to Fast, Google Chrome will avoid rasterization if possible, reducing the amount of rasterization can help reduce print job sizes and increase printing speed.

When this policy is not set, Google Chrome will be in Full mode.</string>
