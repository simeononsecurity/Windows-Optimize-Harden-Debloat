Guidance in DTAM016 requires updates be run daily, automatically or manually. If compliant, the DAT date will be within 24-48 hours old. Since automated update tasks’ success is not guaranteed, the expectation is for update task success to be frequently monitored and corrected when unsuccessful.

This can be done in many ways, such as opening an executable attachment in an email or downloading a program from the Internet. An executable needs to exist on the disk before Windows can run it. A common way for applications to achieve this is to save the file in the user's or system's Temp directory and then run it. One purpose of this rule is to enforce advice that is frequently given to users: "do not open attachments from email." The other purpose of this rule is to close security holes introduced by application bugs.

    <Rule id="V-59365" severity="medium" conversionstatus="pass" title="DTAM170--Access Protection block execution of all programs from temp folder" dscresource="None">
      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;This rule will block any executable from running from the Temp directory; however, this rule is much more restrictive in that it stops nearly all processes from launching in the Temp folder. This provides the most protection, but also has a higher chance of blocking a legitimate application from being installed.
Intention: Most viruses need to be run once by a person before infecting a computer. This can be done in many ways, such as opening an executable attachment in an email, downloading a program from the Internet, etc. For example, &lt;http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_101034.htm&gt;.
An executable needs to exist on the disk before Windows can run it. A common way for applications to achieve this is to save the file in the user’s or system’s Temp directory and then run it.
One purpose of this rule is to enforce advice that is frequently given to people: “don’t open attachments from email.” The other purpose of this rule is to close security holes introduced by application bugs. Older versions of Outlook and Internet Explorer are notorious for automatically executing code without the user needing to do anything but preview an email or view a website.
Risks: All applications that are protected by these rules offer alternatives to running executables, such as saving them somewhere else on the disk and running from there. So the downside of the rules is that users may need to learn a few extra steps before doing things they can do more quickly now.
Note: Enabling this rule may prevent some applications from functioning outright.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>
